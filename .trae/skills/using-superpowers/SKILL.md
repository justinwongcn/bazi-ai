description: Meta-skill that enforces THE RULE - check for relevant skills before ANY work. Invoke when starting any task, even if you think you know what to do. Skills trigger automatically based on context.

# Using Superpowers

## THE RULE

> **If there's even a 1% chance a skill applies to your situation, you MUST invoke it.**

This is not optional. This is not a suggestion. This is mandatory.

## Why This Matters

Skills exist because:
1. They encode proven workflows
2. They prevent common mistakes
3. They ensure consistency
4. They save time (yes, really)

## The Mandatory First Response Protocol

Before ANY response or action:

1. **STOP** - Do not start working
2. **SCAN** - Look at the available skills
3. **MATCH** - Identify which skills apply
4. **INVOKE** - Call the relevant skill(s)
5. **FOLLOW** - Do what the skill says

## Red Flags - When You MUST Use Skills

| Situation | Required Skill |
|-----------|----------------|
| Starting a new feature | brainstorming |
| Requirements unclear | brainstorming |
| Ready to implement | writing-plans |
| Writing code | test-driven-development |
| Something is broken | systematic-debugging |
| Code review needed | requesting-code-review |
| Task complete | finishing-a-development-branch |

## Anti-Rationalizations (These Are WRONG!)

When you think:
- ❌ "This is just a simple question"
  - **WRONG** - Simple questions have complex best practices
  
- ❌ "I need more context first"
  - **WRONG** - The skill provides context. Read it first.
  
- ❌ "I know what that means"
  - **WRONG** - Knowing the concept ≠ using the proven technique
  
- ❌ "Let me explore first"
  - **WRONG** - The skill prevents wasted exploration
  
- ❌ "This feels productive"
  - **WRONG** - Following proven process is more productive
  
- ❌ "The skill seems like overkill"
  - **WRONG** - The 1% rule means you MUST check

## How to Invoke Skills

Skills are invoked automatically when relevant. Just start working on something that matches a skill's trigger conditions.

## Skill Priority

Skills are checked in this order:
1. Project skills (`.trae/skills/`)
2. Personal skills (`~/.config/trae/skills/`)
3. Built-in skills

## The Commitment

By using this system, you commit to:
- Following THE RULE
- Not rationalizing exceptions
- Trusting the process
- Getting better results

## Remember

**The skills exist because they work. Use them.**

Every time you think "I don't need a skill for this", you're about to make a mistake that a skill would have prevented.
